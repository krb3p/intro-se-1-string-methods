# Let's use some methods to manipulate the string stored in Name.

name = "John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt"

# 1. Use puts and a built-in method to print out the string "jOHN jACOB jINGLEHEIMER sCHMIDT"


# 2. Use puts and a built-in method to print out the string "JOHN JACOB JINGELHEIMER SCHMIDT"


# 3. Use puts and a built-in method to print out the string "tdimhcS remiehelgniJ bocaJ nhoJ" (which is the name backwards)


# 4. Use puts and built-in method to find out how many characters are in Mr. Schmidt's name.


# 5. Use puts and a built-in method to count how many times the letter i is in Mr. Schmidt's name.


# 6. Use puts and a built-in method to print out Mr. Schmidt's name, but with all the instances of the letter i removed or deleted.


# 7. Use a built-in method to replace every letter J with the letter G instead. Bonus point if you can say the result out loud without laughing.


# 8. Chain two methods together to print out the string "TDIMHCS REMIEHELGNIJ BOCAJ NHOJ", (which is the name in uppercase and backwards).


# 9. Chain a few methods together to print out the string with all the vowels removed. 


# 10. Try to print the name as four separate strings by using a method that will split it up like this: ["John", "Jacob", "Jingleheimer", "Schmidt"]
